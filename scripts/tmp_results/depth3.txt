every rabbit that did not lick two birds that one bird that did not clean a wild dog did not chase did not come or walk
one dog that accepted one monkey that one cat that did not cry quickly touched did not lick elliot
elliot kicked every bear that a fox that followed every horse that did not lick a tiger touched
