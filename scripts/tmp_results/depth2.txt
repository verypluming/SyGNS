all dogs that chased three lions that two foxes accepted cleaned tom
two horses that all birds that three dogs accepted kissed swam or ran
all dogs that did not follow three bears that rushed slowly cried or swam
daniel did not chase three cats that did not lick two tigers that did not accept all foxes
every horse that did not lick a bear that did not like two small foxes chased ann
every monkey that liked three rabbits that cried lazily escaped and moved
a cat that every bird that did not swim lazily accepted did not dance or move
two birds that did not accept all dogs that did not kiss three tigers slept slowly
a horse that one dog that every polite bear kissed kicked escaped
two horses that three cats that all tigers did not kick did not kiss did not follow tom
