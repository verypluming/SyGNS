ann did not accept one bear that a dog did not kiss
all tigers that did not chase three birds walked or escaped
three dogs that cried slowly did not escape and dance
john did not accept all lions that did not kick two monkeys
every cat that did not kiss all small cats danced or cried
one monkey that licked every small bear did not dance or come
greg did not clean three birds that did not chase all bears
two horses that three lions followed loved daniel
all bears that did not clean two birds did not cry and swim
